Person UI Retrospective\
\
1. I did pretty well on the challenge considering that the margins and safe space methods have changed. After I realized that the instructions were not 100% accurate, I decided to interpret the \'93bound to margins\'94 as \'93bound to safe area\'94. One major step that I almost missed was to set constraints for the horizontal view, which had defaulted to stacking the elements together.\
\
2. Being in the Team Based Mobile Development class, the concepts weren\'92t new to me and I was able to cope pretty easily.\
\
3. All requirements were met\
\
4. Only thing that was changed from the original was the spacing between margins vs. safe space\
\
5. I need to get faster at creating these elements. Even with the instructional issues, it took too long. }
